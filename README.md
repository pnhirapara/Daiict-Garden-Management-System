# 🌿 Garden Management System

*A DBMS project to efficiently manage gardening operations, staff, equipment, and sales — organized, scalable, and data-driven.*

---

## 📚 Project Overview

The **Garden Management System** is a relational database project designed to manage and optimize operations in a large-scale garden or nursery environment.

It provides a centralized platform for:

* 🌱 **Staff Management** – Track supervisors and gardening staff across departments
* 🛠️ **Equipment Tracking** – Maintain records of tools, machines, and maintenance
* 🌳 **Plant & Tree Monitoring** – Store species, growth, and plantation data
* 🛒 **Sales Management** – Handle customers, transactions, and product sales
* 🔁 **Integrated Workflow** – Connect staff, equipment, and operations seamlessly

> "The goal is to bring structure and efficiency to garden operations using relational database design."

## 🛠️ Features

* 🧱 Well-structured relational schema with constraints
* 🔗 Use of foreign keys & referential integrity
* 📊 ER diagram and relational model
* 📄 Modular SQL scripts (DDL + insertions + queries)
* 🔍 Advanced SQL queries (joins, subqueries, window functions)
* 🧪 Tested on PostgreSQL / MySQL

## 🔍 Highlight Queries

Some of the most meaningful queries in this project include:

* ✅ **Department Analysis** – Count staff in each department
* 🔧 **Equipment Insights** – Find equipment needing repair or used daily
* 👨‍🌾 **Staff Tracking** – Retrieve staff under specific supervisors
* 📈 **Sales Analysis** – Top customers and total revenue by manager

## 🧠 Learning & Challenges

> "Designing a complex schema with multiple interconnected entities was challenging but highly rewarding."

During this project, we:

* ✔ Improved SQL fluency and schema design thinking
* ✔ Understood normalization (1NF → BCNF) through implementation
* ✔ Learned debugging complex queries
* ✔ Applied referential integrity constraints
* ✔ Gained teamwork and project structuring experience
